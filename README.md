# kompass
Kompass is an open-source tool designed to help job seekers complete online applications more effectively by simulating human typing behavior. It mimics the natural speed and rhythm of typing, helping to avoid detection by job application systems that flag automated actions like copying and pasting.

## ✅ Character Support – Works Well

Kompass supports a wide range of characters and symbols. Based on extensive testing, the following input types work reliably:

- **Basic Latin characters**  
  Letters (A–Z, a–z), digits (0–9), and standard punctuation

- **Newlines and indentation**  
  Newline (`\n`) and tabs (using spaces or literal tab characters)

- **Common code syntax**  
  JSON, shell commands, C/Java-like syntax, HTML tags, etc.

- **Accented characters (Latin-1 Supplement)**  
  á é í ó ú ü ñ ç à è ì ò ù â ê î ô û

- **Mathematical and currency symbols**  
  π ∑ ∫ ∞ ≈ ≠ ≤ ≥ ± × ÷ √ ∆  
  £ € ¥ ₹ ¢ $

- **Greek and Cyrillic alphabets**  
  Greek: α β γ δ ε ζ η θ ...  
  Cyrillic: А Б В Г Д Е Ё Ж ...

- **Quotes and dashes**  
  ‘ ’ “ ” — – -

- **Most emojis** (✅ when supported by the target app/OS)

> For best results, a delay of **at least 30ms** is recommended.
